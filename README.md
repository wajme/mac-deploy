# MacBook Deployment Playbook
This script will setup will install the standard applicatons I use through Mac App Store [MAS] or via HomeBrew [brew.sh] to provide an automated workflow setup for the easy installation of the software I prefer on a new macbook. This requires initial computer setup and sign into the MAS and iCloud with Apple Account.
